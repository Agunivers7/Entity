Objective: The objective of this program is to create an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that can navigate underwater autonomously. 
The AUV should be able to collect data on water quality, geological makeup, and other ocean characteristics using various sensors.
The program should allow the AUV to complete pre-planned missions without direct control from an operator.
