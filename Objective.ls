#"Objective: The objective of this project is to create an autonomous robotic hand control system using Python and Pygame.
The system should allow users to control a robotic hand using arrow keys in a 2D simulation environment. 
The project aims to provide a hands-on experience in developing a simple robotic control system in a 2D environment using Python and Pygame."
